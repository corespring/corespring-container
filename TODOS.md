~~* rm duplication in component-editor, draft-component-editor, item-component-editor~~
* testing - js/scala
~~* error if there are more than one components in the item model~~

#### The item model from the server has a map of components we are defaulting to the model in '1'.
Is there a more stable way of working with the server?

~~* add commit~~
* rm AppContext + clean up there
