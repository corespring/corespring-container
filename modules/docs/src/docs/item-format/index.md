# Item Format

## Basic format

    {
        //hash map of definitions for the components
        "components" : {
            "uid" : {
                "componentType" : "..",
                 //everything else within this object is specific to the component type.
            } 
        },
        //markup that includes tags that are then referenced in the components object above.
        "xhtml" : ".."
    }
    
## Session Format

The session will also contain a `components` property but this will contain responses that match up with the components hash in the item.

    {
        //hash of answers that match the components in the item
        "components" : {
            "uid" : {
                "componentType" : "..",
                 //everything else within this object is specific to the component type.
            } 
        }
    }

    
## Custom Scoring

An item can override the score that is automatically generated by summing the outcomes of each of the components.

This is done by writing some js in the following format: 

    exports.process = function(item, session){
         
        return {
            //mandatory
            summary: {
                //mandatory
                percentage: 0 //0 -> 100
                //optional
                points: 
                //optional 
                maxPoints:
            },
            //optional - otherwise the default score generator will populate this
            components: {}
        }
    }
    
This js is assigned to the `customScoring` property within the item data model.
