    ul
      li If the graph will be used as an exhibit, enter the line to display on the graph. The line must be entered in y=mx+b form.
      li If the student will interact with the graph,
  li Identify the correct answer by identifying the line the student will graph. The line must be entered in y=mx+b form.
  li Identify an initial line that will be present when the item is launched. The line must be entered in y=mx+b form. This feature is optional.
  li Adjust the Graph attributes. Authors may adjust the following settings:
    ul
      li Width/Height
      li Domain
      li Domain label
      li Range
      li Range label

  li Determine whether the graph should display the point coordinates for points plotted on the graph.
  li Determine whether the graph inputs should be displayed on the graph border.

    ul
      li <b>Correct Answer</b>: Author a feedback message if the interaction if fully correct; the default message is 'Correct!'.
